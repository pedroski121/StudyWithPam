          Water, we drink water everyday. We bathe with water everyday, we use
          water to do our laundries, and our dish washing. Basically 98% of
          everything in this life requires water. From our secondary school, we
          only know water to be H2O and just that only. Well, from this point
          henceforth, you’d be looking at water differently, you’d stop seeing
          it as just some liquid used in washing, for drinking etc, you’d be
          seeing water from the BIOCHEMICAL view and that mates, it’s for the
          best. Shall we begin, comrades? BIOCHEMISTRY OF WATER. Water, a
          biogenic compound, whose molecular formula is H20, is generally
          referred to as the solvent of life, why? Let’s look at the few points
          why it’s referred to as such All organisms are composed primarily of
          water, such that most eukaryotic organisms are about 90 percent water,
          while prokaryotes are about 70 percent water. No organism, not even
          the prokaryotes, can develop and grow without water. All chemical
          reactions in organisms occur in liquid water. Being polar, water has
          unique properties. These include its role as a solvent, as a chemical
          reactant, and as a factor to maintain a fairly constant temperature.
          Before we continue, let’s look at some of the biological functions of
          water in the human body. BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF WATER Water in the
          human body, helps in transport, how? It helps in transporting oxygen
          and other nutrients in the body. It serves as lubricant of the joints,
          yes! Water is the major lubricant in the synovial fluid of joints.
          Without water, many biochemical reactions or processes won’t take
          place in the body. What I’m basically saying is; water serves as a
          substrate for biochemical reactions. These are but few biological
          functions of water. Remember, I wrote that the molecular formula for
          water is H20, yep, that means, it has 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 one
          oxygen atom. Let’s now look at the electronic structure of water.
          ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF WATER A molecule of water is composed of two
          atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. The one and only electron
          ring around the nucleus of each hydrogen atom has only one electron.
          The negative charge of the electron is balanced by the positive charge
          of one proton in the hydrogen nucleus. The electron ring of hydrogen
          would actually prefer to possess two electrons to create a stable
          configuration. Oxygen, on the other hand, has two electron rings with
          an inner ring having 2 electrons, which is cool because that is a
          stable configuration. The outer ring, on the other hand, has 6
          electrons but it would like to have 2 more because, in the second
          electron ring, 8 electrons is the stable configuration. To balance the
          negative charge of 8 (2+6) electrons, the oxygen nucleus has 8
          protons. Hydrogen and oxygen would like to have stable electron
          configurations but do not as individual atoms. They can get out of
          this predicament if they agree to share electrons (a sort of an energy
          “treaty”). So, oxygen shares one of its outer electrons with each of
          two hydrogen atoms, and each of the two hydrogen atoms shares it’s one
          and only electron with oxygen. This is called a covalent bond. Each
          hydrogen atom thinks it has two electrons, and the oxygen atom thinks
          that it has 8 outer electrons. Everybody’s happy, no?
